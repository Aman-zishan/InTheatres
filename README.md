## UI


Trying to recreate UI designed by <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2784573-Rottentomatoes-App-Concept">Ghani Pradita</a> from dribbble.

<div align="center">
<img width="50%" src="movie_review.png"/>
</div>

Hence i had to change the *tomatometer* UI element to rating section fetched from Omdb API.

This app is still under development.
